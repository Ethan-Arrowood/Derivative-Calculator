# Derivative-Calculator
Derivative Calculator - Project Lead: Ethan Arrowood

Goal of this project is to create a Derivative Function calculator that can understand basic derivative solving techniques: power rule, product and quotient rule, trig rules, logarithmic rules, and chain rule.

Support for Implicit Differentiation is not needed until all normal rules are completed. 

I will be doing the project in JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but if you can implement another language like Python, go ahead!

Please be thorough in your commit descriptions / pull requests. 

This is my first time managing a GitHub Repository so if you have any tips for me please let me know!

Lastly, I know calculators like this alreadt exist and are probably much better than I can create, but I'm doing this for learning purposes and practicing things like parsing, regex, and GitHub.
